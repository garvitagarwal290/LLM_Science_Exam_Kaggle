# Description

This is my implementation of an LLM model for answering hard science multiple-choice questions (MCQ) based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The inspiration for this project came from Kaggle's `LLM Science Exam' competition. Some help was taken from this video of the YouTube channel DataScienceCastnet and a couple of other videos.
